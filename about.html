            <p>Being in a sorority and kissing the Blarney Stone have helped me build an ability to speak with just about anyone. In my project experience, collaborating on interview plans helped curate questions that were most appropriate and beneficial. I'm a strong believer in the idea that it isn't always about what is being said so much as how it is being conveyed. We all reference past experiences to create an understanding and sometimes, you just have to say the same thing in different words. It's something I practice often and use to improve my communication all around. My experience in customer service has made me more aware of the value of empathy and although research isn't my main focus, it is something I've enjoyed being part of in a team setting. Initial interviews, prior to any ideation, can provide such valuable feedback on what is needed. It's using this information to build on ideas and user flow through a product that especially piques my interest.
